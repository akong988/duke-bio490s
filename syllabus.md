# BIO490S - Methods in Computational Biology & Genomics

Instructor: C. Ryan Campbell

(mailto:c.ryan.campbell@duke.edu)
Office: BioSci 311
Hours: Mon 3-5, Wed 10-12

## Learning Objectives			
1. teaching programming basics within a biology framework (i.e. basic building blocks for students to use biological software):
	* using command line interfaces		
	* accessing supercomputers/clusters		
	* building scripts		
	* using biological programs (bwa, samtools, etc)		

2. the statistics that underlie these tools, the whole suite of measures used in "genomics" and probably not covered in Bio 204.

3. combine #1 & #2 to test one of a range of biological questions, answerable with RNAseq data, such as: what is the effect of hibernation (lemur), morph type (cricket), tissue type (crayfish), closing mechanism (venus flytrap), and salty ecotypes (cotton) on gene expression across the tree of life.

### Prerequisites
- One of BIO201/202
- STA101 or higher OR BIO204
- Some coding background (computer language independent)
